> A collection of assignments regarding Network Communication utilising CISCO Packet Tracer

This repository showcases three practical assignments from the Data Communication and Net-Centric Computing (DCNC) course. Utilizing Cisco Packet Tracer, these projects delve into fundamental concepts such as the TCP/IP Model, addressing and routing; Hamming Code, Error Detetection &amp; Protection and P2P Networking. Each assignment includes detailed network designs and simulations, providing hands-on demonstrations of key networking principles alongside written theory.
