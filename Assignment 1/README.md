> Demonstration of the relationship between DNS and HTTPS servers. Theory of reliable data transfer.


A network that consists of 3 PCs, a printer, a DNS server, and an HTTP/HTTPS server. The primary goal was to establish connectivity amongst these devices using TCP/IP protocols, configure DNS resolution for web access, and demonstrate subnetting principles for efficient network management. This project involves CISCO Packet Tracer.

   <summary>Further Assignment context</summary>
   <br>
   The network is configured using TCP/IP protocols to facilitate reliable data transmission between devices. Setting up the DNS server to host a domain and redirect requests to the HTTPS server, which serves a secure website was a key objective of the Packet Tracer component.
   <br><br>
   Subnet allocation (mask &amp; host number) is calculated to optimize network efficiency. The assignment explores subnetting principles; demonstrates how packets travel through the network; highlights routing decisions and packet forwarding mechanisms. This approach aims to deepen the understanding of network design, protocol implementation, and the operational dynamics of essential network services like DNS and HTTPS.
