> Demonstration of Hamming Code knowledge and Error Tolerance. Theory of the Frame Check Sequence (FCS) and Error Control practices (Data Link Layer).

The assignment investigates error control mechanisms in digital communication, focusing on the practical application &amp; theoretical understanding of Hamming Code. The concept of Hamming Code is utilized to create a robust &amp; error-tolerant binary bit. Further integrating concepts of error detection and correction alongside Frame Check Sequence (FCS) and Data Link Layer protocols.

   <summary>Further Assignment context</summary>
   <br>
   A practical implementation of Hamming code is developed using a chart. This involves encoding binary data with Hamming code techniques, where parity bits are strategically added to the data stream. The assignment demonstrates how errors introduced during data transmission can be detected and corrected using the redundancy provided by Hamming code.
   <br><br>
   The assignment investigates how the Frame Check Sequence is computed and appended to data packets to verify data integrity during transmission, through a series of calculations.
   <br><br>
   Further investigation delves into error control mechanisms at the Data Link Layer, including ARQ protocols such as Stop-and-Wait, Go-Back-N ARQ and Selective Repeat ARQ. The project evaluates their performance metrics, such as trade-offs and efficiency, in managing errors and ensuring reliable data transmission.
